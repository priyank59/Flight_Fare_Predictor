# Flight_Fare_Predictor
I have a build model that detects fare prices of your flight journey using various parameters like no of stops, airline company, duration. I have used kaggle data set which has travel history of flights in 2019. I have to do lot of feature enginieering since the initial features were in string format. I have compared regression models using gridsearch cv with hyperparameters and the xgboost model was best suitable for the dataset.
